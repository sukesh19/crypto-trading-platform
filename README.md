📈 Crypto Trading Platform – Automated Cryptocurrency Trading Bot
This project is an easy-to-use, automated crypto trading platform that helps you trade cryptocurrencies smoothly and securely on major exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase Pro. It combines real-time market data with popular technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, EMA, and Bollinger Bands to automatically make buy and sell decisions so you don’t have to watch the market constantly.

You can customize trading strategies, backtest them on historical data, and run the bot in live or simulated (paper) trading modes. The platform lets you monitor trades in real-time through a clean command-line interface or a web dashboard.

Built with Python, it uses powerful libraries like CCXT for exchange connections, Pandas for data crunching, and TA-Lib for technical analysis. It also handles secure API key storage, error handling, logging, and can send notifications via Telegram or Discord to keep you informed.

This platform is ideal if you’re a developer, data scientist, or trader looking for a robust foundation to build and personalize your own algorithmic trading bot—offering transparency, flexibility, and control over your trading strategies and risks.

If you want it tailored for beginners, emphasize a web UI, add advanced ML-driven strategies, or include decentralized exchange (DEX) support, just ask!

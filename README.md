## ðŸ“ˆ Crypto Trading Platform â€“ Automated Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

This project is a fully-featured, automated crypto trading platform designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies efficiently and securely across major exchanges. It leverages real-time market data, technical indicators, and customizable trading strategies to automate buy and sell decisions with minimal human intervention.

The platform supports integration with popular centralized exchanges (like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase Pro) via API and allows users to configure strategies using technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, EMA, and Bollinger Bands. Users can backtest strategies on historical data, run bots in live or paper trading modes, and monitor trades in real-time through a clean command-line interface or web dashboard.

Built with Python and powered by libraries such as CCXT for exchange connectivity, Pandas for data analysis, and TA-Lib for technical indicators, the platform is highly extensible and developer-friendly. It also supports secure API key storage, logging, error handling, and notifications through services like Telegram or Discord.

Ideal for developers, data scientists, or traders with a technical background, this project provides a foundation for building personalized, algorithmic trading bots while maintaining transparency and control over risk.
